# Routing

## Route Structure
The application uses a page-based routing structure.
Each page represents a route-level component.

## Public Routes
Public routes are accessible without authentication.
These typically include landing pages or public views.

## Protected Routes
Protected routes require authentication and are guarded
to prevent unauthorized access.

## Guards and Layouts
Route guards and layout components can be used to wrap
protected routes and enforce access control when needed.
